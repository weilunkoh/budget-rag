The Majulah Package comprises the following: \\n \\n(A) Annual Earn and Save Bonus; \\n(B) One-time Retirement Savings Bonus; and \\n(C) One-time MediSave Bonus.  \\n \\nEvery Singaporean born in 1973 or earlier will receive at least one component of the Majulah \\nPackage. The Package will benefit about 1.6 million Singaporeans. \\n \\nThe Majulah Package is estimated to cost $8.2 billion in total  lifetime costs. The Government \\nwill set aside $7.5 billion in a new Fund, the Majulah Package Fund, to fund these lifetime \\ncosts.  \\n \\n(A) Earn and Save Bonus (“ESB”) \\n \\nSingaporeans born in 1973 or earlier will receive the ESB if they meet the following criteria:  \\n \\n(i) Work and have an average monthly income of between $500 and $6,000;  \\n(ii) Live in a residence with Annual Value (“AV”) of $25,000 and below; and  \\n(iii) Own not more than one property.   \\n \\nEligibility for the ESB will be assessed annually, based on income from the preceding Year of \\nAssessment (employment and trade income) as well as AV and property ownership in the \\npreceding year.  \\n \\nThe ESB will be tiered by their average monthly income (see Table 1 below). The first annual \\nESB will be credited to their CPF Retirement Account ( “RA”) or Special Account (“SA”) in \\nMarch 2025.   \\n \\nTable 1: Quantum for the ESB \\nAverage Monthly Income1, 2 Annual Bonus3 \\n$500 to $2,500 $1,000 \\nAbove $2,500 to $3,500  $700 \\nAbove $3,500 to $6,000 $400 \\nNotes: \\n1.

When the increases have been fully implemented, those aged above 55 to 60 will have the \\nsame CPF contribution rates as younger workers. \\n \\nTable 1: Current and Target CPF Contribution Rates (Employer + Employee) by Age Band \\nAge Band 2016–2021 Current CPF Contribution \\nRates (As of 1 January 2024) By ~2030 \\n55 and below 37.0% No change \\nAbove 55 to 60 26.0% 31.0% 37.0% \\nAbove 60 to 65 16.5% 22.0% 26.0% \\nAbove 65 to 70 12.5% 16.5% 16.5% \\nAbove 70 12.5% No change \\nNote: \\n1. The timeline is subject to change, depending on prevailing economic conditions.  \\nThe Government has implemented the increase in senior workers’ CPF contribution rates for \\nworkers aged above 55 to 70 each year since 1 January 2022. We reached the target \\ncontribution rates for senior workers aged above 65 to 70 in 2024.  \\nThe next increase in senior workers’ CPF contribution rates for workers aged above 55 \\nto 65 will take place on 1 January 2025 , as shown in Table 2. The increase in contribution \\nrates will be fully allocated to the CPF Special Account (“SA”) or Retirement Account (“RA”) \\nto help senior workers save more for retirement.   \\nTo mitigate the rise in business costs due to this increase, the Government will provide \\nemployers with a one-year CPF Transition Offset equivalent to half of the 2025 increase in \\nemployer CPF contribution rates for every Singaporean and Permanent Resident worker they \\nemploy aged above 55 to 65 (see Table 2). This will be provided automatically and employers \\ndo not need to apply for the offset. \\n\\n \\n2 \\nMINISTRY OF FINANCE \\nTable 2: CPF Contribution Rates for Senior Workers from 1 January 2025 \\nAge Band CPF Contribution Rates from 1 January 2025 CPF Transition \\nOffset for 2025 Total Employer Employee \\n55 and below No change \\nAbove 55 to 60 32.5% \\n(+1.5%-pt) \\n15.5% \\n(+0.5%-pt) \\n17.0% \\n(+1%-pt) 0.25%-pt \\nAbove 60 to 65 23.5% \\n(+1.5%-pt) \\n12.0% \\n(+0.5%-pt) \\n11.5% \\n(+1%-pt) 0.25%-pt \\nAbove 65 to 70 No change (target contribution rates were reached in 2024) \\nAbove 70 No change \\nNotes: \\n1. The CPF contribution rates are stated as a percentage of wages. \\n2. The percentage point figures in parentheses refer to the increase in CPF contribution rates from 1 January \\n2025, compared to current rates as of 1 January 2024. \\n \\n(B) Increase in Enhanced Retirement Sum (“ERS”) \\n \\nThe ERS is the maximum amount of savings that members aged 55 and above can place in \\ntheir CPF Retirement Account (“RA”) to earn RA interest rates and receive CPF monthly \\npayouts. Today, the ERS is set at three times the Basic Retirement Sum (“BRS”).  \\n \\nThe Government will raise the ERS from three times the BRS, to four times, from 1 \\nJanuary 2025 (see Table 3). This will allow CPF members to voluntarily top up more to their \\nRA, by transferring their Ordinary Account (“OA”) savings or by making cash top-ups, in order \\nto receive higher CPF monthly payouts in their retirement.  \\n \\nTable 3: Revised ERS from 2025 to 2027 \\nYear BRS \\nBefore Changes \\n \\n(ERS at three times the \\nBRS) \\nRevised ERS from 1 \\nJanuary 2025  \\n(ERS at four times the \\nBRS) \\nERS \\nEstimated \\nmonthly \\npayouts \\nERS \\nEstimated \\nmonthly \\npayouts \\n2025 $106,500 $319,500 $2,530 $426,000 $3,330 \\n2026 $110,200 $330,600 $2,610 $440,800 $3,440 \\n2027 $114,100 $342,300 $2,690 $456,400 $3,550 \\nNotes: \\n1. There are no changes to the previously announced BRS and Full Retirement Sum for 2025 to 2027. \\n2. Estimated monthly payouts are based on the payouts of a  male member who sets aside the ERS at age \\n55 and starts payouts under the CPF LIFE Standard Plan at age 65. \\n \\nWith the raising of the ERS, more members aged 55 and above can opt to fully commit their \\naccumulated CPF savings to receive higher CPF payouts.  \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n\\n \\n3 \\nMINISTRY OF FINANCE \\n(C) Closure of the CPF Special Account (“SA”) for Members Aged 55 and Above \\n \\nToday, members aged 55 and above have two CPF accounts that hold savings intended for \\nretirement payouts: the CPF SA and the Retirement Account (“RA”). Both SA and RA savings \\nearn the same long-term interest rate. However, some SA savings can be withdrawn on demand \\nfrom age 55. As a principle, only savings that cannot be withdrawn on demand should earn the \\nlong-term interest rate, and savings that can b e withdrawn on demand should earn the short -\\nterm interest rate.  \\n \\nTo better align CPF interest rates to the nature of CPF savings  in each CPF account , the \\nGovernment will close the SA for members aged 55 and above from early 2025. SA savings \\nwill be transferred to the RA, up to the Full Retirement Sum . These savings will continue to \\nearn the long-term interest rate. Any remaining SA savings will be transferred to the Ordinary \\nAccount (“OA”), where they remain withdrawable and will earn the short-term interest rate.  \\n \\nMembers can choose to transfer their OA savings to their RA at any time, up to the Enhanced \\nRetirement Sum. Once transferred to the RA, the monies will be committed towards higher \\nretirement payouts and will earn higher interest.   \\n \\nWith the closure of the SA for members aged 55 and above, all members will have three CPF \\naccounts at any one time: \\n \\n• For members below age 55, they will continue to have OA, SA, and MediSave Account \\n(“MA”).   \\n• For members aged 55 and above, they will only have OA, RA, MA.  \\n \\n(D) Enhancements to the Silver Support Scheme (“SSS”) \\n \\nThe SSS supports Singaporeans aged 65 and above who had low incomes during their working \\nyears, and have less family support.  \\n \\nThe SSS will be enhanced to strengthen support for these seniors. From 1 January 2025:  \\n \\n(i) Quarterly payments will be raised by 20% across all payment tiers (see Table 4 \\nbelow).  \\n \\n(ii) Criterion for monthly per capita household income  will be raised. \\nSingaporeans aged 65 and above with monthly per capita household income of not \\nmore than $2,300 and meet all other eligibility criteria will be eligible for the SSS, \\nup from the current criterion of $1,800 (see Table 4 below).  \\n \\n  \\n\\n \\n4 \\nMINISTRY OF FINANCE \\nTable 4: Current and Enhanced Silver Support Quarterly Payments from 1 January 2025 \\nHDB Flat \\nType2 \\nCurrent From 1 January 2025 \\nTotal CPF contributions of not more than $140,000 by age 551 \\nMonthly per \\ncapita \\nhousehold \\nincome of \\n$1,300 or less \\nMonthly per \\ncapita \\nhousehold \\nincome above \\n$1,300 but not \\nmore than \\n$1,800 \\nMonthly per \\ncapita \\nhousehold \\nincome of \\n$1,500 or less \\nMonthly per \\ncapita \\nhousehold \\nincome above \\n$1,500 but not \\nmore than \\n$2,300 \\n1- and 2-\\nroom $900 $450 $1,080 $540 \\n3-room $720 $360 $860 $430 \\n4-room $540 $270 $650 $325 \\n5-room3 $360 $180 $430 $215 \\nNotes: \\n1. Self-employed persons should also have an average annual net trade income of not more than $27,600 \\nwhen they were aged 45 to 54.  \\n2. Neither s enior nor his or her spouse  should owna 5 -room or larger HDB flat or private property or \\nmultiple properties. \\n3. Senior may live in, but do not own, a 5-room HDB flat.  \\n \\nThe enhanced SSS will benefit around 290,000 Singaporeans aged 65 and above. \\n \\nThere is no need to apply for the SSS. All Singaporeans aged 65 and above are automatically \\nassessed for eligibility. Those who qualify for the SSS will be notified by the CPF Board. All \\nrecipients of the enhanced SSS will receive their first payment in December 2024.   \\n \\nSilver Support payments will continue to supplement the monthly cash assistance provided by \\nthe ComCare Long-Term Assistance (“LTA”) Scheme1. All Singaporeans aged 65 and above \\nwho are ComCare LTA beneficiaries will receive a Silver Support payment of $430 per quarter. \\nAside from monthly cash assistance to cover daily living expenses, ComCare LTA \\nbeneficiaries receive assistance with their med ical bills at public healthcare institutions and \\nfree or highly subsidised social services such as home help. \\n \\n(E) Enhancements to the Matched Retirement Savings Scheme (“MRSS”) \\n \\nIn 2021, the Government introduced the MRSS as a pilot. Under the current MRSS, the \\nGovernment will match every dollar of cash top-up made to eligible CPF members aged 55 to \\n70, up to an annual cap of $600. Anyone, including their families, employers, and the \\ncommunity, can make the top-ups to these eligible members’ CPF Retirement Account (“RA”). \\nGivers may also be entitled to tax relief ( i.e., CPF Cash Top-Up Relief) for cash top -ups that \\nattract the MRSS matching grant. \\n \\n \\n1 Also known as the Public Assistance Scheme. The Scheme is targeted at those who are permanently unable to \\nwork due to old age, illness or disability, have limited or no means of income, and little or no family support.  \\n\\n \\n5 \\nMINISTRY OF FINANCE \\nThe Government will continue the MRSS beyond the current pilot, expand the age \\neligibility, and increase the matching grant cap from 1 January 2025  (details in Table 5). \\nThis is to strengthen Singapore’s social compact and enable more seniors to meet their \\nretirement needs. \\n \\nFrom 1 January 2025, we will also remove the tax relief that givers may get on cash top -\\nups that attract the MRSS matching grant (see Table 5), as the matching grant is already a \\nsignificant benefit extended by the Government. A giver may continue to enjoy tax relief of up \\nto $16,000 a year for eligible CPF cash top-ups that do not attract the MRSS matching grant2.  \\n \\nTable 5: Changes to the MRSS from 1 January 2025 \\nChanges Current From 1 January 2025 \\nIncrease in \\nmatching grant \\ncap \\n$600 per year $2,000 per year, with a $20,000 cap \\nover an eligible member’s lifetime \\nRemoval of age \\ncap \\n55 to 70 years old 55 years old and above \\nRemoval of tax \\nrelief on cash \\ntop-ups for \\ngivers \\nGivers are eligible for tax relief \\non cash top -ups they make to \\nMRSS-eligible members \\nGivers are not eligible for tax relief on \\ncash top -ups that attract the MRSS \\nmatching grant \\nNote: \\n1. There is no change to the other eligibility criteria: \\na. RA savings below prevailing Basic Retirement Sum. RA savings refer to the cash set aside in \\nthe RA (excluding amounts such as interest earned, any government grants received) plus \\namounts withdrawn such as monthly payouts and lump-sum withdrawals; \\nb. Average monthly income not more than $4,000;  \\nc. Owns not more than one property; and \\nd. Annual value of residence is not more than $21,000. \\n \\nWith the enhancements, the number of CPF members eligible for MRSS is expected to increase \\nfrom 395,000 in 2024 to approximately 800,000 in 2025.  \\n \\nMRSS eligibility is automatically assessed every year. CPF Board will notify eligible members \\nat the beginning of each year and members can also check their eligibility via the CPF website. \\nAs long as eligible members receive a cash top -up within the year,  they will receive the \\nmatching grant the following year.  \\n \\n  \\n \\n2 A member may continue to enjoy tax relief of up to $8,000 per year for cash top -ups he makes to his own SA, \\nRA or MediSave Account, and another $8,000 per year for cash top-ups to such accounts of his loved ones.  \\n\\n \\n6 \\nMINISTRY OF FINANCE \\nMore Information \\n \\nMeasure Contact Details \\nIncrease in Senior Worker CPF Contribution Rates Please contact the CPF \\nBoard at \\ncpf.gov.sg/contact-us   Increase   in Enhanced Retirement Sum \\nClosure of the CPF Special Account for Members Aged 55 \\nand Above \\nSilver Support Scheme \\nMatched Retirement Savings Scheme \\nCPF Transition Offset Please contact IRAS at \\ngo.gov.sg/askpayout1', mimetype='text/plain', start_char_idx=2, end_char_idx=12294, text_template='{metadata_str}\\n\\n{content}', metadata_template='{key}: {value}', metadata_seperator='\\n'), score=0.36106872060148476), NodeWithScore(node=TextNode(id_='00622567-648c-4256-9d90-22cc920aaaad', embedding=None, metadata={'filename': 'budget_booklet_pg8_individual_support.txt', 'url': 'https://www.mof.gov.sg/docs/librariesprovider3/budget2024/download/pdf/fy2024_support_for_singaporeans_english.pdf'}, excluded_embed_metadata_keys=[], excluded_llm_metadata_keys=[], relationships={<NodeRelationship.SOURCE: '1'>: RelatedNodeInfo(node_id='f023926d-0c4f-4c42-ac88-c77f3d304f54', node_type=<ObjectType.DOCUMENT: '4'>, metadata={'filename': 'budget_booklet_pg8_individual_support.txt', 'url': 'https://www.mof.gov.sg/docs/librariesprovider3/budget2024/download/pdf/fy2024_support_for_singaporeans_english.pdf'}, hash='cad7a32be10b70e890e7025160c71498b5450d43f114ac1e591c885cdabbcdd3')}, text=\"Support for Singaporean Individuals\\nThese are the benefits provided to Singaporean individuals from April 2024 to March 2025, subjected to the individual's eligibility.\\n\\n- Cash: $200 to $2,150 for all Singaporeans aged 21 and above\\n- Personal Income Tax Rebate: 50% of tax payable for the Year of Assessment 2024, capped at $200\\n- CPF MediSave Account: $100 to $1,650 for all Singaporeans\\n- CPF Retirement or Special Account: $400 to $2,500 for Singaporeans born in 1973 or earlier\\n- NS LifeSG Credits: $200 for all past and present national servicemen\", mimetype='text/plain', start_char_idx=0, end_char_idx=552, text_template='{metadata_str}\\n\\n{content}', metadata_template='{key}: {value}', metadata_seperator='\\n'), score=0.3576665186985485)]\n",
