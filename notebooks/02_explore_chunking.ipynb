The CIT Rebate, less any CIT Rebate Cash Grant received, \\nwill be automatically incorporated in the companies’ tax assessments raised after they file their \\nCIT returns for YA 2024.  \\n \\nFor example, Company A hired two local employees in 2023. It has a CIT assessment of \\n$30,000 for YA 2024. Company A will receive a $2,000 CIT Rebate Cash Grant by 3Q 2024. \\nIt will receive another $13,000 [(50% * $30,000) - $2,000] in CIT Rebate in its YA 2024 CIT \\nassessment. \\n \\nThe maximum total benefits of CIT Rebate and CIT Rebate Cash Grant that a company may \\nreceive is $40,000. \\n \\nA company is considered to have met the local employee condition if it has made CPF \\ncontributions to at least one local ( i.e., Singapore Citizen or Permanent Resident) employee, \\nexcluding shareholders who are also directors of the company, in the calendar year 2023. \\n \\n(B) Enhancements to the Enterprise Financing Scheme (“EFS”) \\n \\nThe EFS enables Singapore enterprises to access financing more readily across all stages of \\ngrowth. There will be three enhancements to the EFS under the Enterprise Support Package.  \\n \\nFirst, the maximum loan quantum under the EFS – SME Working Capital Loan will be \\npermanently enhanced from $300,000 to $500,000. This will help SMEs to meet their increased \\nworking capital and operational cashflow needs, especially amid elevated costs. \\n \\nSecond, the enhanced maximum loan quantum under the EFS – Trade Loan of $10 million will \\nbe extended till 31 March 2025. This will support businesses’ internationalisation efforts amid \\nglobal supply chain disruptions. \\n \\n\\n \\n2 \\nMINISTRY OF FINANCE \\nThird, support for domestic construction projects under the EFS – Project Loan will be \\nextended till 31 March 2025, with maximum loan quantum of $15 million. This will support \\ndomestic construction firms amid a challenging operating environment.  \\n \\n(C) Extension of the SkillsFuture Enterprise Credit (“SFEC”) \\n \\nThe SFEC encourages employers to undertake enterprise and workforce transformation \\ninitiatives. Eligible firms have received a one-off credit of up to $10,000 to cover up to 90% of \\nout-of-pocket expenses for supportable enterprise capability development and workforce \\ntransformation programmes. To encourage employ ers to undertake workforce transformation \\nto reskill and upskill their workers, $3,000 of the SFEC is reserved for workforce \\ntransformation programmes.1   \\n \\nThe SFEC will be extended for a year  to 30 June 2025. This means that employers who have \\nalready received the SFEC will be able to use it on supportable schemes beyond 30 June 2024, \\nwith claims to be submitted by 30 June 2025. \\n \\nThe current list of SFEC-supportable programmes is at Table 1.

The RIC encourages companies to make sizeable investments \\nthat bring substantive economic activities to Singapore, in key economic sectors and new \\ngrowth areas. It will be awarded on an approval basis, through EDB and EnterpriseSG.  \\n \\nThe RIC will support high-value and substantive economic activities such as:  \\n \\n(i) Investing in new productive capacity (e.g., new manufacturing plant, production of \\nlow-carbon energy);  \\n(ii) Expanding or establishing the scope of activities in digital services, professional \\nservices, and supply chain management;  \\n(iii) Expanding or establishing headquarter activities, or Centres of Excellence; \\n(iv) Setting up or expansion of activities by commodity trading firms;  \\n(v) Carrying out R&D and innovation activities; and \\n(vi) Implementing solutions with decarbonisation objectives.  \\n \\nHow the RIC works \\nThe RIC is awarded on qualifying expenditures incurred by the company in respect of a \\nqualifying project, during the qualifying period. Each RIC award will have a qualifying period \\nof up to 10 years. \\nThe credits are to be offset against Corporate Income Tax payable. Any unutilised credits will \\nbe refunded to the company in cash within four years from when the company satisfies the \\nconditions for receiving the credits. The scheme is consistent with the Global Anti -Base \\nErosion Rules for Qualified Refundable Tax Credits. \\n \\nThe quantum of RIC that a company can receive will depend on the support rates predetermined \\nfor the company’s different qualifying expenditure categories . Support rates will be \\ncommensurate with the economic outcomes (or decarbonisation outcomes for decarbonisation \\nprojects) that the project is expected to bring.  \\n \\nDepending on project type, qualifying expenditure categories may include: \\n \\n(i) Capital expenditure (e.g. building, civil and structural works, plant and machinery, \\nsoftware);  \\n(ii) Manpower costs; \\n(iii) Training costs; \\n(iv) Professional fees; \\n(v) Intangible asset costs; \\n(vi) Fees for work outsourced in Singapore;  \\n(vii) Materials and consumables; and \\n(viii) Freight and logistics costs. \\n \\n\\n \\n2 \\nMINISTRY OF FINANCE \\nCompanies can receive up to 50% of support on each qualifying expenditure category. The \\ntotal quantum of RIC that a company is eligible for will be determined by EDB or \\nEnterpriseSG.  \\n \\nMore Information \\n \\nScheme Contact Details \\nRefundable Investment Credit  More information will be available on the \\nEDB and EnterpriseSG websites by 3Q 2024. \\nIn the meantime, companies may contact \\nEDB or EnterpriseSG.   \\n \\n ', mimetype='text/plain', start_char_idx=None, end_char_idx=None, text_template='{metadata_str}\\n\\n{content}', metadata_template='{key}: {value}', metadata_seperator='\\n'),\n",

It comprises three new measures: \\n \\n(A) $4,000 SkillsFuture Credit (Mid-Career) Top-Up; \\n(B) Support for mid -career Singaporeans to pursue another subsidised full -time \\nDiploma; and \\n(C) SkillsFuture Mid-Career Training Allowance. \\n \\n(A) $4,000 SkillsFuture Credit (“SFC”) (Mid-Career) Top-Up \\n \\nThe SFC was introduced at Budget 2015 to encourage Singaporeans to take ownership of their \\nskills development. To provide more support for mid -career Singaporeans, we will provide a \\n$4,000 SFC (Mid-Career) top-up to every Singaporean in the year they turn 40 years old .  \\nSingaporeans currently aged 40 and above will receive the top-up in May 2024. The credit will \\nhave no expiry date. \\n \\nEligible individuals can use the SFC top-up for selected courses that are industry-oriented and \\nhave better employability outcomes. More details on eligible courses will be announced at the \\nMOE Committee of Supply.  \\n \\n(B) Support for Singaporeans to pursue another subsidised Full-Time Diploma \\n \\nCurrently, individuals who have previously received MOE subsidies or  Government \\nsponsorship for a diploma or higher qualification (e.g., degree) are not eligible for another \\nsubsidised full-time diploma qualification at our institutions. \\n \\nFrom Academic Year 2025, Singaporeans aged 40 and above will qualify for the Mid -Career \\nEnhanced Subsidy for another subsidised full-time diploma at our Polytechnics, ITE, and Arts \\nInstitutions (i.e., Nanyang Academy of Fine Arts and LASALLE College of the Arts). This \\nwill expand the opportunities available for mid-career Singaporeans to take subsidised courses.  \\n \\n(C) SkillsFuture Mid-Career Training Allowance \\n \\nTo better support mid -career workers who need to undergo substantive reskilling, we will \\nprovide a training allowance to Singaporeans aged 40 and above who undertake full-time long-\\nform training, to partially offset the income loss from taking time off from work.

The \\nGovernment will make the following adjustments: \\n \\n(A) Enhance the Workfare Income Supplement Scheme; \\n(B) Raise the Local Qualifying Salary; and \\n(C) Enhance the Progressive Wage Credit Scheme.  \\n \\n(A) Enhancements to the Workfare Income Supplement Scheme (“Workfare”)  \\n \\nWorkfare supplements the incomes and CPF savings of lower-wage Singaporean workers, and \\nencourages them to work regularly. Employees do not need to apply for Workfare, as eligibility \\nis automatically assessed based on CPF contributions. Self -employed persons will have to \\ndeclare their income, and make the required MediSave contributions to receive Workfare \\npayments. \\n \\nEnhancements to Workfare will apply to work done from 1 January 2025. The enhanced \\nWorkfare will benefit around half a million Singaporeans.  \\n \\nEnhancements to Workfare \\n \\n(i) Qualifying monthly wage cap will be raised from $2,500 to $3,000.1 This takes \\ninto account wage growth of Singaporeans. The higher qualifying monthly wage \\ncap of $3,000 will also apply to the Workfare Skills Support scheme. \\n \\n(ii) Higher Workfare payments of up to $4,900  per year. Payments, which depend \\non age and wages, will be enhanced across all age bands. Eligible employees will \\nreceive up to $4,900 per year, compared to $4,200 per year today (see Table 1). \\nOlder workers and all persons with disabilities will continue to receive the highest \\npayments. The payments for self -employed persons are set at two -thirds of the \\npayments for employees, and will be correspondingly increased. \\n \\nTable 1: Maximum Annual Workfare Payments for Employees \\nAge Band \\nBefore Enhancement  \\n(For Work Done from 1 Jan \\n2023 to 31 Dec 2024) \\nAfter Enhancement  \\n(For Work Done from 1 Jan \\n2025) \\n30-34   $2,100                       $2,450 \\n35-44  $3,000  $3,500  \\n45-59 $3,600  $4,200  \\n60 & above  $4,200  $4,900  \\nAll persons with \\ndisabilities  \\n$4,200  $4,900  \\n \\n \\n  \\n \\n1 In addition, the worker must earn an average gross monthly wage of not more than $3,000 in the past 12 months. \\n\\n \\n2 \\nMINISTRY OF FINANCE \\n \\n(B) Raising the Local Qualifying Salary (“LQS”) \\n \\nAs part of our Progressive Wages moves, firms hiring foreign workers are required to pay all \\ntheir local workers at least the LQS. The number of local workers paid the LQS is used to \\ndetermine the firm’s foreign worker quota entitlement. \\n \\nThe LQS is regularly reviewed to keep pace with wage growth, to continue to uplift lower -\\nwage workers and maintain foreign workforce controls.  \\n \\nThe Government will raise the LQS from $1,400 to $1,600  per month. Firms hiring foreign \\nworkers will have to pay all their local workers at least the LQS (or Progressive Wage Model \\nwages where applicable):   \\n \\n(i) At least $1,600 per month for full-time local workers; or   \\n(ii) At least $10.50 per hour for part-time local workers.   \\n  \\nForeign worker quota computation will correspondingly be adjusted with the new LQS:   \\n \\n(i) 1 local workforce count: Per local worker who is paid  at least $1,600 per month; \\nor   \\n(ii) 0.5 local workforce count: Per local worker who is paid at least $800 but less than \\n$1,600 per month.  \\n  \\nThese changes will be implemented from 1 July 2024.  \\n \\n(C) Enhancements to the Progressive Wage Credit Scheme (“PWCS”) \\n \\nThe PWCS was introduced at Budget 2022 to provide transitional support from 2022 to 2026 \\nto help employers adjust to the Progressive Wages moves, as well as encourage employers to \\nvoluntarily raise the wages of their lower-wage employees.  \\n  \\nThe PWCS co-funds the wage increases that employers give to resident lower-wage employees \\nwith gross monthly wages of up to $3,000. The average gross monthly wage increase must be \\nat least $100 in each qualifying year. Wage increases given in each qualifying year will be co-\\nfunded for two years, if the wage increase is sustained. This is to help employers manage the \\ncompounding effect of wage increases year on year. \\n  \\nIncrease in PWCS Co-Funding Support for 2024 \\n  \\nTo strengthen support for employers in uplifting lower-wage employees, the PWCS co-funding \\nsupport will be enhanced for wage increases given in qualifying year 2024 (see Table 2). The \\nenhanced co-funding support will also apply to wage increases given in qualifying year 2023 \\nthat are sustained in 2024.  \\n  \\nIncrease in Wage Ceiling for PWCS Co-Funding from 2025 Onwards \\n  \\nThe gross monthly wage ceiling for PWCS co-funding will be increased from $2,500 to $3,000 \\nin qualifying years 2025 and 2026 (see Table 2).  \\n \\n\\n \\n3 \\nMINISTRY OF FINANCE \\n \\nTable 2: PWCS Co-Funding Levels for Eligible Wage Increases from 2022 to 2026 \\nQualifying \\nYear  \\nPayout \\nPeriod  \\nCurrent Enhanced \\nFirst Tier:  \\nGross Monthly \\nWage Ceiling \\n≤ $2,500  \\nSecond Tier: \\nGross Monthly \\nWage Ceiling   \\n> $2,500 and ≤ \\n$3,000  \\nFirst Tier:  \\nGross Monthly \\nWage Ceiling \\n≤ $2,500  \\nSecond Tier:  \\nGross Monthly \\nWage Ceiling   \\n> $2,500 and ≤ \\n$3,000  \\n2022  Q1 2023  75%1 45%1 75% 45% \\n2023  Q1 2024  75%2 45%2 75% 45% \\n2024  Q1 2025  30% 15% 50% \\n(+20%-pt) \\n30% \\n(+15%-pt) \\n      \\nSingle Tier:  \\nGross Monthly Wage Ceiling ≤ \\n$2,500  \\nSingle Tier:  \\nGross Monthly Wage Ceiling ≤ \\n$3,000 \\n(+$500) \\n2025  Q1 2026  30%  30% \\n2026  Q1 2027  15%  15%  \\nNotes: \\n1.

When the increases have been fully implemented, those aged above 55 to 60 will have the \\nsame CPF contribution rates as younger workers. \\n \\nTable 1: Current and Target CPF Contribution Rates (Employer + Employee) by Age Band \\nAge Band 2016–2021 Current CPF Contribution \\nRates (As of 1 January 2024) By ~2030 \\n55 and below 37.0% No change \\nAbove 55 to 60 26.0% 31.0% 37.0% \\nAbove 60 to 65 16.5% 22.0% 26.0% \\nAbove 65 to 70 12.5% 16.5% 16.5% \\nAbove 70 12.5% No change \\nNote: \\n1. The timeline is subject to change, depending on prevailing economic conditions.  \\nThe Government has implemented the increase in senior workers’ CPF contribution rates for \\nworkers aged above 55 to 70 each year since 1 January 2022. We reached the target \\ncontribution rates for senior workers aged above 65 to 70 in 2024.  \\nThe next increase in senior workers’ CPF contribution rates for workers aged above 55 \\nto 65 will take place on 1 January 2025 , as shown in Table 2. The increase in contribution \\nrates will be fully allocated to the CPF Special Account (“SA”) or Retirement Account (“RA”) \\nto help senior workers save more for retirement.   \\nTo mitigate the rise in business costs due to this increase, the Government will provide \\nemployers with a one-year CPF Transition Offset equivalent to half of the 2025 increase in \\nemployer CPF contribution rates for every Singaporean and Permanent Resident worker they \\nemploy aged above 55 to 65 (see Table 2). This will be provided automatically and employers \\ndo not need to apply for the offset. \\n\\n \\n2 \\nMINISTRY OF FINANCE \\nTable 2: CPF Contribution Rates for Senior Workers from 1 January 2025 \\nAge Band CPF Contribution Rates from 1 January 2025 CPF Transition \\nOffset for 2025 Total Employer Employee \\n55 and below No change \\nAbove 55 to 60 32.5% \\n(+1.5%-pt) \\n15.5% \\n(+0.5%-pt) \\n17.0% \\n(+1%-pt) 0.25%-pt \\nAbove 60 to 65 23.5% \\n(+1.5%-pt) \\n12.0% \\n(+0.5%-pt) \\n11.5% \\n(+1%-pt) 0.25%-pt \\nAbove 65 to 70 No change (target contribution rates were reached in 2024) \\nAbove 70 No change \\nNotes: \\n1.

The percentage point figures in parentheses refer to the increase in CPF contribution rates from 1 January \\n2025, compared to current rates as of 1 January 2024. \\n \\n(B) Increase in Enhanced Retirement Sum (“ERS”) \\n \\nThe ERS is the maximum amount of savings that members aged 55 and above can place in \\ntheir CPF Retirement Account (“RA”) to earn RA interest rates and receive CPF monthly \\npayouts. Today, the ERS is set at three times the Basic Retirement Sum (“BRS”).  \\n \\nThe Government will raise the ERS from three times the BRS, to four times, from 1 \\nJanuary 2025 (see Table 3). This will allow CPF members to voluntarily top up more to their \\nRA, by transferring their Ordinary Account (“OA”) savings or by making cash top-ups, in order \\nto receive higher CPF monthly payouts in their retirement.  \\n \\nTable 3: Revised ERS from 2025 to 2027 \\nYear BRS \\nBefore Changes \\n \\n(ERS at three times the \\nBRS) \\nRevised ERS from 1 \\nJanuary 2025  \\n(ERS at four times the \\nBRS) \\nERS \\nEstimated \\nmonthly \\npayouts \\nERS \\nEstimated \\nmonthly \\npayouts \\n2025 $106,500 $319,500 $2,530 $426,000 $3,330 \\n2026 $110,200 $330,600 $2,610 $440,800 $3,440 \\n2027 $114,100 $342,300 $2,690 $456,400 $3,550 \\nNotes: \\n1. There are no changes to the previously announced BRS and Full Retirement Sum for 2025 to 2027. \\n2. Estimated monthly payouts are based on the payouts of a  male member who sets aside the ERS at age \\n55 and starts payouts under the CPF LIFE Standard Plan at age 65. \\n \\nWith the raising of the ERS, more members aged 55 and above can opt to fully commit their \\naccumulated CPF savings to receive higher CPF payouts.  \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n\\n \\n3 \\nMINISTRY OF FINANCE \\n(C) Closure of the CPF Special Account (“SA”) for Members Aged 55 and Above \\n \\nToday, members aged 55 and above have two CPF accounts that hold savings intended for \\nretirement payouts: the CPF SA and the Retirement Account (“RA”). Both SA and RA savings \\nearn the same long-term interest rate. However, some SA savings can be withdrawn on demand \\nfrom age 55. As a principle, only savings that cannot be withdrawn on demand should earn the \\nlong-term interest rate, and savings that can b e withdrawn on demand should earn the short -\\nterm interest rate.  \\n \\nTo better align CPF interest rates to the nature of CPF savings  in each CPF account , the \\nGovernment will close the SA for members aged 55 and above from early 2025. SA savings \\nwill be transferred to the RA, up to the Full Retirement Sum . These savings will continue to \\nearn the long-term interest rate. Any remaining SA savings will be transferred to the Ordinary \\nAccount (“OA”), where they remain withdrawable and will earn the short-term interest rate.  \\n \\nMembers can choose to transfer their OA savings to their RA at any time, up to the Enhanced \\nRetirement Sum. Once transferred to the RA, the monies will be committed towards higher \\nretirement payouts and will earn higher interest.   \\n \\nWith the closure of the SA for members aged 55 and above, all members will have three CPF \\naccounts at any one time: \\n \\n• For members below age 55, they will continue to have OA, SA, and MediSave Account \\n(“MA”).   \\n• For members aged 55 and above, they will only have OA, RA, MA.  \\n \\n(D) Enhancements to the Silver Support Scheme (“SSS”) \\n \\nThe SSS supports Singaporeans aged 65 and above who had low incomes during their working \\nyears, and have less family support.  \\n \\nThe SSS will be enhanced to strengthen support for these seniors. From 1 January 2025:  \\n \\n(i) Quarterly payments will be raised by 20% across all payment tiers (see Table 4 \\nbelow).  \\n \\n(ii) Criterion for monthly per capita household income  will be raised. \\nSingaporeans aged 65 and above with monthly per capita household income of not \\nmore than $2,300 and meet all other eligibility criteria will be eligible for the SSS, \\nup from the current criterion of $1,800 (see Table 4 below).  \\n \\n  \\n\\n \\n4 \\nMINISTRY OF FINANCE \\nTable 4: Current and Enhanced Silver Support Quarterly Payments from 1 January 2025 \\nHDB Flat \\nType2 \\nCurrent From 1 January 2025 \\nTotal CPF contributions of not more than $140,000 by age 551 \\nMonthly per \\ncapita \\nhousehold \\nincome of \\n$1,300 or less \\nMonthly per \\ncapita \\nhousehold \\nincome above \\n$1,300 but not \\nmore than \\n$1,800 \\nMonthly per \\ncapita \\nhousehold \\nincome of \\n$1,500 or less \\nMonthly per \\ncapita \\nhousehold \\nincome above \\n$1,500 but not \\nmore than \\n$2,300 \\n1- and 2-\\nroom $900 $450 $1,080 $540 \\n3-room $720 $360 $860 $430 \\n4-room $540 $270 $650 $325 \\n5-room3 $360 $180 $430 $215 \\nNotes: \\n1. Self-employed persons should also have an average annual net trade income of not more than $27,600 \\nwhen they were aged 45 to 54.  \\n2. Neither s enior nor his or her spouse  should owna 5 -room or larger HDB flat or private property or \\nmultiple properties. \\n3. Senior may live in, but do not own, a 5-room HDB flat.  \\n \\nThe enhanced SSS will benefit around 290,000 Singaporeans aged 65 and above. \\n \\nThere is no need to apply for the SSS. All Singaporeans aged 65 and above are automatically \\nassessed for eligibility. Those who qualify for the SSS will be notified by the CPF Board. All \\nrecipients of the enhanced SSS will receive their first payment in December 2024.   \\n \\nSilver Support payments will continue to supplement the monthly cash assistance provided by \\nthe ComCare Long-Term Assistance (“LTA”) Scheme1. All Singaporeans aged 65 and above \\nwho are ComCare LTA beneficiaries will receive a Silver Support payment of $430 per quarter. \\nAside from monthly cash assistance to cover daily living expenses, ComCare LTA \\nbeneficiaries receive assistance with their med ical bills at public healthcare institutions and \\nfree or highly subsidised social services such as home help. \\n \\n(E) Enhancements to the Matched Retirement Savings Scheme (“MRSS”) \\n \\nIn 2021, the Government introduced the MRSS as a pilot. Under the current MRSS, the \\nGovernment will match every dollar of cash top-up made to eligible CPF members aged 55 to \\n70, up to an annual cap of $600. Anyone, including their families, employers, and the \\ncommunity, can make the top-ups to these eligible members’ CPF Retirement Account (“RA”). \\nGivers may also be entitled to tax relief ( i.e., CPF Cash Top-Up Relief) for cash top -ups that \\nattract the MRSS matching grant. \\n \\n \\n1 Also known as the Public Assistance Scheme. The Scheme is targeted at those who are permanently unable to \\nwork due to old age, illness or disability, have limited or no means of income, and little or no family support.  \\n\\n \\n5 \\nMINISTRY OF FINANCE \\nThe Government will continue the MRSS beyond the current pilot, expand the age \\neligibility, and increase the matching grant cap from 1 January 2025  (details in Table 5). \\nThis is to strengthen Singapore’s social compact and enable more seniors to meet their \\nretirement needs. \\n \\nFrom 1 January 2025, we will also remove the tax relief that givers may get on cash top -\\nups that attract the MRSS matching grant (see Table 5), as the matching grant is already a \\nsignificant benefit extended by the Government. A giver may continue to enjoy tax relief of up \\nto $16,000 a year for eligible CPF cash top-ups that do not attract the MRSS matching grant2.  \\n \\nTable 5: Changes to the MRSS from 1 January 2025 \\nChanges Current From 1 January 2025 \\nIncrease in \\nmatching grant \\ncap \\n$600 per year $2,000 per year, with a $20,000 cap \\nover an eligible member’s lifetime \\nRemoval of age \\ncap \\n55 to 70 years old 55 years old and above \\nRemoval of tax \\nrelief on cash \\ntop-ups for \\ngivers \\nGivers are eligible for tax relief \\non cash top -ups they make to \\nMRSS-eligible members \\nGivers are not eligible for tax relief on \\ncash top -ups that attract the MRSS \\nmatching grant \\nNote: \\n1.

Average monthly income not more than $4,000;  \\nc. Owns not more than one property; and \\nd. Annual value of residence is not more than $21,000. \\n \\nWith the enhancements, the number of CPF members eligible for MRSS is expected to increase \\nfrom 395,000 in 2024 to approximately 800,000 in 2025.  \\n \\nMRSS eligibility is automatically assessed every year. CPF Board will notify eligible members \\nat the beginning of each year and members can also check their eligibility via the CPF website. \\nAs long as eligible members receive a cash top -up within the year,  they will receive the \\nmatching grant the following year.  \\n \\n  \\n \\n2 A member may continue to enjoy tax relief of up to $8,000 per year for cash top -ups he makes to his own SA, \\nRA or MediSave Account, and another $8,000 per year for cash top-ups to such accounts of his loved ones.  \\n\\n \\n6 \\nMINISTRY OF FINANCE \\nMore Information \\n \\nMeasure Contact Details \\nIncrease in Senior Worker CPF Contribution Rates Please contact the CPF \\nBoard at \\ncpf.gov.sg/contact-us   Increase   in Enhanced Retirement Sum \\nClosure of the CPF Special Account for Members Aged 55 \\nand Above \\nSilver Support Scheme \\nMatched Retirement Savings Scheme \\nCPF Transition Offset Please contact IRAS at \\ngo.gov.sg/askpayout1 \\n ', mimetype='text/plain', start_char_idx=None, end_char_idx=None, text_template='{metadata_str}\\n\\n{content}', metadata_template='{key}: {value}', metadata_seperator='\\n'),\n",

Gross monthly household income includes basic employment income, \\ntrade/self-employed income, overtime pay, allowances, cash awards, commissions, and bonuses.  \\n2 These are Acute Hospital, Day Surgery, Extended Diagnosis Treatment Unit, Community Hospital, and \\nSpecialist Outpatient Clinic settings/services. \\n3 MOH Long-Term Care Residential services include Nursing Home, Chronic Sick (High/Low), Inpatient Hospice \\nPalliative Care Service, Psychiatric Rehabilitation Home, and Psychiatric Sheltered Home. MOH Long -Term \\nCare Non-Residential services include home-based services (e.g., Home Palliative Care, Home Medical services, \\nHome Nursing services, Home Help services, Home Personal Care) and centre -based services (e.g., Community \\nRehabilitation, Maintenance Day Care, Dementia Day Care, Day Hospice,  Psychiatric Day Rehabilitation). \\n4 MSF’s Residential services include Adult Disability Home, Adult Disability Hostel, Children Disability Home, \\nand Sheltered Home. MSF’s Non-Residential services include Day Activity Centre and Home-Based Behavioural \\nIntervention Services. \\n\\n \\n2 \\nMINISTRY OF FINANCE \\nTable 1.

Qualifying overseas cash donations must meet the \\nfollowing two conditions to be eligible for tax deductions: \\n \\n(i) Donation must be made through a designated  charity. Designated charities should \\nhave emergency humanitarian assistance as part of their charitable objectives 1, as \\nwell as enhanced governance and controls against illicit fund flows. Charities that \\nqualify will be invited to participate in the pilot. The list of designated charities will \\nbe made available from 1 January 2025. \\n \\n(ii) Donation must be made towards a fund -raiser for emergency humanitarian \\nassistance with a valid Fund -Raising for Foreign Charitable Purposes ( “FRFCP”) \\npermit from the Commissioner of Charities ( “COC”). Designated charities are \\nrequired to apply for a FRFCP permit from the COC prior to commencement of a \\nfund-raising appeal for an emergency humanitarian assistance cause.  \\n \\nThe COC will determine upon reviewing the FRFCP permit application whether a fund-raiser \\nin question is for an emergency humanitarian assistance cause. Emergency humanitarian \\nassistance refers to emergency assistance tied to a specific incident with a clear trigger such as \\nin response to natural disasters (e.g. , earthquakes or floods) or other sudden crises (e.g. , \\npandemics). Assistance typically includes rapid delivery of essentials such as food, clean water, \\nshelter, medical care, and search, rescue, and evacuation efforts. \\n \\nTax deductions under OHAS will be capped at 40% of the donor’s statutory income.

Zincode participated in the Smart \\nManufacturing Joint Lab and was involved in developing an optical inspection system that was \\neventually deployed at Rolls -Royce’s fan blade manufacturing facility in Singapore. This \\nresulted in Zincode being appointed as one of Rolls-Royce’s approved vendors. Subsequently, \\nZincode was also referred to other departments within Rolls -Royce for their  improvement \\nprojects. \\n \\nWith proven capabilities in AI inspection technologies and improved standing within the \\nindustry, Zincode went on to secure contracts with other aerospace companies and enjoyed a \\n30% increase in sales . Beyond the aerospace sector, Zincode has also successfully proposed \\nAI inspection solutions to semiconductor and medical devices companies. \\n \\n(B) Section D: Equipping Our Workers for Life \\n \\nMr Calvin Li Junming \\n \\nCalvin (age 40) is a Project Director with Khoon Engineering Contractor Pte Ltd, a Singapore-\\nbased mechanical and electrical service provider. He has been with the company for over 7 \\nyears and manages several electrical engineering projects as the overall project lead.  \\n \\nCalvin believes that continuous training and upskilling can broaden his career opportunities \\nand allow him to contribute widely within the workforce.  Having pivoted from the finance to \\nelectrical engineering industry, he is not deterred by new challenges and has been receptive to \\nmid-career switches.  To enhance career mobility, he has been  acquiring a wide range of \\nskillsets, from management-related skills offered by trade associations and tertiary institutions, \\nto technical knowledge from Workforce Singapo re's Career Conversion Programme for \\nSustainability Professionals. \\n \\nCalvin is continuously looking for new ways to learn and incorporate new skills in his work. \\nHe finds the upskilling useful in helping him to add value to the projects that he oversees, like \\nexploring the deployment of more sustainable, energy -efficient equipment, and sourcing for \\npotentially low-carbon emission materials. \\nAccording to Calvin, “What you study in school isn’t what you become or where you end up. \\nIt’s about your mindset, what’s more important is that you are willing to try. Learning is a \\nnever-ending process.”  \\n\\n \\n2 \\nMINISTRY OF FINANCE \\n(C) Section E: Creating More Paths to Equality and Mobility \\n \\nMr Matthew Francis Thanarajoo \\n \\nMatthew (age 23) is currently pursuing a Diploma in Mechatronics at Temasek Polytechnic \\n(“TP”) after obtaining a Higher Nitec in Mechatronics at ITE College Central in 2021. \\n \\nMatthew represented TP in the Mechatronics category at the WorldSkills Singapore \\ncompetition, where he won a Medallion for Excellence in Phase 1 (held in March 2023) and a \\nGold in Phase 2 (held in September 2023). He will go on to represent Singapore at the \\nWorldSkills Competition in Lyon, France, in September 2024. \\n \\nThrough his diploma programme, Matthew has had many opportunities to grow his knowledge \\nin the engineering field and take part in competitions that tested and enhanced his technical \\nknowledge. This has equipped him with the experience and confidence to achieve his \\naspirations. \\n \\n(D) Section F: Providing More Assurance for Families and Seniors \\n \\nMdm Rubiah Binte Rahim \\n \\nMdm Rubiah (age 68) first learnt about Healthier SG from the news and subsequently attended \\na Healthier SG roadshow, before enrolling in the programme.  \\n \\nAt her first consultation, she gained tips on better managing her health by eating healthily and \\nstaying active. Mdm Rubiah now visits a nearby Active Ageing Centre (“AAC”), Lions \\nBefrienders @ 420A Clementi, almost daily. At the AAC, she takes part in activities such as \\nbingo, recycled arts and crafts, and exercises like drumming and ball games. She also attend s \\ntalks on health and digital skills.

The CIT Rebate, less any CIT Rebate Cash Grant received, \\nwill be automatically incorporated in the companies’ tax assessments raised after they file their \\nCIT returns for YA 2024.  \\n \\nFor example, Company A hired two local employees in 2023. It has a CIT assessment of \\n$30,000 for YA 2024. Company A will receive a $2,000 CIT Rebate Cash Grant by 3Q 2024. \\nIt will receive another $13,000 [(50% * $30,000) - $2,000] in CIT Rebate in its YA 2024 CIT \\nassessment. \\n \\nThe maximum total benefits of CIT Rebate and CIT Rebate Cash Grant that a company may \\nreceive is $40,000. \\n \\nA company is considered to have met the local employee condition if it has made CPF \\ncontributions to at least one local ( i.e., Singapore Citizen or Permanent Resident) employee, \\nexcluding shareholders who are also directors of the company, in the calendar year 2023. \\n \\n(B) Enhancements to the Enterprise Financing Scheme (“EFS”) \\n \\nThe EFS enables Singapore enterprises to access financing more readily across all stages of \\ngrowth. There will be three enhancements to the EFS under the Enterprise Support Package.  \\n \\nFirst, the maximum loan quantum under the EFS – SME Working Capital Loan will be \\npermanently enhanced from $300,000 to $500,000. This will help SMEs to meet their increased \\nworking capital and operational cashflow needs, especially amid elevated costs. \\n \\nSecond, the enhanced maximum loan quantum under the EFS – Trade Loan of $10 million will \\nbe extended till 31 March 2025. This will support businesses’ internationalisation efforts amid \\nglobal supply chain disruptions. \\n \\n\\n \\n2 \\nMINISTRY OF FINANCE \\nThird, support for domestic construction projects under the EFS – Project Loan will be \\nextended till 31 March 2025, with maximum loan quantum of $15 million. This will support \\ndomestic construction firms amid a challenging operating environment.  \\n \\n(C) Extension of the SkillsFuture Enterprise Credit (“SFEC”) \\n \\nThe SFEC encourages employers to undertake enterprise and workforce transformation \\ninitiatives. Eligible firms have received a one-off credit of up to $10,000 to cover up to 90% of \\nout-of-pocket expenses for supportable enterprise capability development and workforce \\ntransformation programmes. To encourage employ ers to undertake workforce transformation \\nto reskill and upskill their workers, $3,000 of the SFEC is reserved for workforce \\ntransformation programmes.1   \\n \\nThe SFEC will be extended for a year  to 30 June 2025. This means that employers who have \\nalready received the SFEC will be able to use it on supportable schemes beyond 30 June 2024, \\nwith claims to be submitted by 30 June 2025. \\n \\nThe current list of SFEC-supportable programmes is at Table 1.

The RIC encourages companies to make sizeable investments \\nthat bring substantive economic activities to Singapore, in key economic sectors and new \\ngrowth areas. It will be awarded on an approval basis, through EDB and EnterpriseSG.  \\n \\nThe RIC will support high-value and substantive economic activities such as:  \\n \\n(i) Investing in new productive capacity (e.g., new manufacturing plant, production of \\nlow-carbon energy);  \\n(ii) Expanding or establishing the scope of activities in digital services, professional \\nservices, and supply chain management;  \\n(iii) Expanding or establishing headquarter activities, or Centres of Excellence; \\n(iv) Setting up or expansion of activities by commodity trading firms;  \\n(v) Carrying out R&D and innovation activities; and \\n(vi) Implementing solutions with decarbonisation objectives.  \\n \\nHow the RIC works \\nThe RIC is awarded on qualifying expenditures incurred by the company in respect of a \\nqualifying project, during the qualifying period. Each RIC award will have a qualifying period \\nof up to 10 years. \\nThe credits are to be offset against Corporate Income Tax payable. Any unutilised credits will \\nbe refunded to the company in cash within four years from when the company satisfies the \\nconditions for receiving the credits. The scheme is consistent with the Global Anti -Base \\nErosion Rules for Qualified Refundable Tax Credits. \\n \\nThe quantum of RIC that a company can receive will depend on the support rates predetermined \\nfor the company’s different qualifying expenditure categories . Support rates will be \\ncommensurate with the economic outcomes (or decarbonisation outcomes for decarbonisation \\nprojects) that the project is expected to bring.  \\n \\nDepending on project type, qualifying expenditure categories may include: \\n \\n(i) Capital expenditure (e.g. building, civil and structural works, plant and machinery, \\nsoftware);  \\n(ii) Manpower costs; \\n(iii) Training costs; \\n(iv) Professional fees; \\n(v) Intangible asset costs; \\n(vi) Fees for work outsourced in Singapore;  \\n(vii) Materials and consumables; and \\n(viii) Freight and logistics costs. \\n \\n\\n \\n2 \\nMINISTRY OF FINANCE \\nCompanies can receive up to 50% of support on each qualifying expenditure category.

The \\nGovernment will make the following adjustments: \\n \\n(A) Enhance the Workfare Income Supplement Scheme; \\n(B) Raise the Local Qualifying Salary; and \\n(C) Enhance the Progressive Wage Credit Scheme.  \\n \\n(A) Enhancements to the Workfare Income Supplement Scheme (“Workfare”)  \\n \\nWorkfare supplements the incomes and CPF savings of lower-wage Singaporean workers, and \\nencourages them to work regularly. Employees do not need to apply for Workfare, as eligibility \\nis automatically assessed based on CPF contributions. Self -employed persons will have to \\ndeclare their income, and make the required MediSave contributions to receive Workfare \\npayments. \\n \\nEnhancements to Workfare will apply to work done from 1 January 2025. The enhanced \\nWorkfare will benefit around half a million Singaporeans.  \\n \\nEnhancements to Workfare \\n \\n(i) Qualifying monthly wage cap will be raised from $2,500 to $3,000.1 This takes \\ninto account wage growth of Singaporeans. The higher qualifying monthly wage \\ncap of $3,000 will also apply to the Workfare Skills Support scheme. \\n \\n(ii) Higher Workfare payments of up to $4,900  per year. Payments, which depend \\non age and wages, will be enhanced across all age bands. Eligible employees will \\nreceive up to $4,900 per year, compared to $4,200 per year today (see Table 1). \\nOlder workers and all persons with disabilities will continue to receive the highest \\npayments.

The number of local workers paid the LQS is used to \\ndetermine the firm’s foreign worker quota entitlement. \\n \\nThe LQS is regularly reviewed to keep pace with wage growth, to continue to uplift lower -\\nwage workers and maintain foreign workforce controls.  \\n \\nThe Government will raise the LQS from $1,400 to $1,600  per month. Firms hiring foreign \\nworkers will have to pay all their local workers at least the LQS (or Progressive Wage Model \\nwages where applicable):   \\n \\n(i) At least $1,600 per month for full-time local workers; or   \\n(ii) At least $10.50 per hour for part-time local workers.   \\n  \\nForeign worker quota computation will correspondingly be adjusted with the new LQS:   \\n \\n(i) 1 local workforce count: Per local worker who is paid  at least $1,600 per month; \\nor   \\n(ii) 0.5 local workforce count: Per local worker who is paid at least $800 but less than \\n$1,600 per month.  \\n  \\nThese changes will be implemented from 1 July 2024.  \\n \\n(C) Enhancements to the Progressive Wage Credit Scheme (“PWCS”) \\n \\nThe PWCS was introduced at Budget 2022 to provide transitional support from 2022 to 2026 \\nto help employers adjust to the Progressive Wages moves, as well as encourage employers to \\nvoluntarily raise the wages of their lower-wage employees.  \\n  \\nThe PWCS co-funds the wage increases that employers give to resident lower-wage employees \\nwith gross monthly wages of up to $3,000. The average gross monthly wage increase must be \\nat least $100 in each qualifying year. Wage increases given in each qualifying year will be co-\\nfunded for two years, if the wage increase is sustained. This is to help employers manage the \\ncompounding effect of wage increases year on year. \\n  \\nIncrease in PWCS Co-Funding Support for 2024 \\n  \\nTo strengthen support for employers in uplifting lower-wage employees, the PWCS co-funding \\nsupport will be enhanced for wage increases given in qualifying year 2024 (see Table 2). The \\nenhanced co-funding support will also apply to wage increases given in qualifying year 2023 \\nthat are sustained in 2024.  \\n  \\nIncrease in Wage Ceiling for PWCS Co-Funding from 2025 Onwards \\n  \\nThe gross monthly wage ceiling for PWCS co-funding will be increased from $2,500 to $3,000 \\nin qualifying years 2025 and 2026 (see Table 2).  \\n \\n\\n \\n3 \\nMINISTRY OF FINANCE \\n \\nTable 2: PWCS Co-Funding Levels for Eligible Wage Increases from 2022 to 2026 \\nQualifying \\nYear  \\nPayout \\nPeriod  \\nCurrent Enhanced \\nFirst Tier:  \\nGross Monthly \\nWage Ceiling \\n≤ $2,500  \\nSecond Tier: \\nGross Monthly \\nWage Ceiling   \\n> $2,500 and ≤ \\n$3,000  \\nFirst Tier:  \\nGross Monthly \\nWage Ceiling \\n≤ $2,500  \\nSecond Tier:  \\nGross Monthly \\nWage Ceiling   \\n> $2,500 and ≤ \\n$3,000  \\n2022  Q1 2023  75%1 45%1 75% 45% \\n2023  Q1 2024  75%2 45%2 75% 45% \\n2024  Q1 2025  30% 15% 50% \\n(+20%-pt) \\n30% \\n(+15%-pt) \\n      \\nSingle Tier:  \\nGross Monthly Wage Ceiling ≤ \\n$2,500  \\nSingle Tier:  \\nGross Monthly Wage Ceiling ≤ \\n$3,000 \\n(+$500) \\n2025  Q1 2026  30%  30% \\n2026  Q1 2027  15%  15%  \\nNotes: \\n1.

When the increases have been fully implemented, those aged above 55 to 60 will have the \\nsame CPF contribution rates as younger workers. \\n \\nTable 1: Current and Target CPF Contribution Rates (Employer + Employee) by Age Band \\nAge Band 2016–2021 Current CPF Contribution \\nRates (As of 1 January 2024) By ~2030 \\n55 and below 37.0% No change \\nAbove 55 to 60 26.0% 31.0% 37.0% \\nAbove 60 to 65 16.5% 22.0% 26.0% \\nAbove 65 to 70 12.5% 16.5% 16.5% \\nAbove 70 12.5% No change \\nNote: \\n1.

We reached the target \\ncontribution rates for senior workers aged above 65 to 70 in 2024.  \\nThe next increase in senior workers’ CPF contribution rates for workers aged above 55 \\nto 65 will take place on 1 January 2025 , as shown in Table 2. The increase in contribution \\nrates will be fully allocated to the CPF Special Account (“SA”) or Retirement Account (“RA”) \\nto help senior workers save more for retirement.   \\nTo mitigate the rise in business costs due to this increase, the Government will provide \\nemployers with a one-year CPF Transition Offset equivalent to half of the 2025 increase in \\nemployer CPF contribution rates for every Singaporean and Permanent Resident worker they \\nemploy aged above 55 to 65 (see Table 2).

Today, the ERS is set at three times the Basic Retirement Sum (“BRS”).  \\n \\nThe Government will raise the ERS from three times the BRS, to four times, from 1 \\nJanuary 2025 (see Table 3). This will allow CPF members to voluntarily top up more to their \\nRA, by transferring their Ordinary Account (“OA”) savings or by making cash top-ups, in order \\nto receive higher CPF monthly payouts in their retirement.  \\n \\nTable 3: Revised ERS from 2025 to 2027 \\nYear BRS \\nBefore Changes \\n \\n(ERS at three times the \\nBRS) \\nRevised ERS from 1 \\nJanuary 2025  \\n(ERS at four times the \\nBRS) \\nERS \\nEstimated \\nmonthly \\npayouts \\nERS \\nEstimated \\nmonthly \\npayouts \\n2025 $106,500 $319,500 $2,530 $426,000 $3,330 \\n2026 $110,200 $330,600 $2,610 $440,800 $3,440 \\n2027 $114,100 $342,300 $2,690 $456,400 $3,550 \\nNotes: \\n1. There are no changes to the previously announced BRS and Full Retirement Sum for 2025 to 2027. \\n2. Estimated monthly payouts are based on the payouts of a  male member who sets aside the ERS at age \\n55 and starts payouts under the CPF LIFE Standard Plan at age 65. \\n \\nWith the raising of the ERS, more members aged 55 and above can opt to fully commit their \\naccumulated CPF savings to receive higher CPF payouts.  \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n\\n \\n3 \\nMINISTRY OF FINANCE \\n(C) Closure of the CPF Special Account (“SA”) for Members Aged 55 and Above \\n \\nToday, members aged 55 and above have two CPF accounts that hold savings intended for \\nretirement payouts: the CPF SA and the Retirement Account (“RA”). Both SA and RA savings \\nearn the same long-term interest rate. However, some SA savings can be withdrawn on demand \\nfrom age 55. As a principle, only savings that cannot be withdrawn on demand should earn the \\nlong-term interest rate, and savings that can b e withdrawn on demand should earn the short -\\nterm interest rate.  \\n \\nTo better align CPF interest rates to the nature of CPF savings  in each CPF account , the \\nGovernment will close the SA for members aged 55 and above from early 2025. SA savings \\nwill be transferred to the RA, up to the Full Retirement Sum . These savings will continue to \\nearn the long-term interest rate. Any remaining SA savings will be transferred to the Ordinary \\nAccount (“OA”), where they remain withdrawable and will earn the short-term interest rate.  \\n \\nMembers can choose to transfer their OA savings to their RA at any time, up to the Enhanced \\nRetirement Sum. Once transferred to the RA, the monies will be committed towards higher \\nretirement payouts and will earn higher interest.   \\n \\nWith the closure of the SA for members aged 55 and above, all members will have three CPF \\naccounts at any one time: \\n \\n• For members below age 55, they will continue to have OA, SA, and MediSave Account \\n(“MA”).   \\n• For members aged 55 and above, they will only have OA, RA, MA.  \\n \\n(D) Enhancements to the Silver Support Scheme (“SSS”) \\n \\nThe SSS supports Singaporeans aged 65 and above who had low incomes during their working \\nyears, and have less family support.  \\n \\nThe SSS will be enhanced to strengthen support for these seniors. From 1 January 2025:  \\n \\n(i) Quarterly payments will be raised by 20% across all payment tiers (see Table 4 \\nbelow).  \\n \\n(ii) Criterion for monthly per capita household income  will be raised. \\nSingaporeans aged 65 and above with monthly per capita household income of not \\nmore than $2,300 and meet all other eligibility criteria will be eligible for the SSS, \\nup from the current criterion of $1,800 (see Table 4 below).  \\n \\n  \\n\\n \\n4 \\nMINISTRY OF FINANCE \\nTable 4: Current and Enhanced Silver Support Quarterly Payments from 1 January 2025 \\nHDB Flat \\nType2 \\nCurrent From 1 January 2025 \\nTotal CPF contributions of not more than $140,000 by age 551 \\nMonthly per \\ncapita \\nhousehold \\nincome of \\n$1,300 or less \\nMonthly per \\ncapita \\nhousehold \\nincome above \\n$1,300 but not \\nmore than \\n$1,800 \\nMonthly per \\ncapita \\nhousehold \\nincome of \\n$1,500 or less \\nMonthly per \\ncapita \\nhousehold \\nincome above \\n$1,500 but not \\nmore than \\n$2,300 \\n1- and 2-\\nroom $900 $450 $1,080 $540 \\n3-room $720 $360 $860 $430 \\n4-room $540 $270 $650 $325 \\n5-room3 $360 $180 $430 $215 \\nNotes: \\n1. Self-employed persons should also have an average annual net trade income of not more than $27,600 \\nwhen they were aged 45 to 54.  \\n2. Neither s enior nor his or her spouse  should owna 5 -room or larger HDB flat or private property or \\nmultiple properties. \\n3. Senior may live in, but do not own, a 5-room HDB flat.  \\n \\nThe enhanced SSS will benefit around 290,000 Singaporeans aged 65 and above. \\n \\nThere is no need to apply for the SSS. All Singaporeans aged 65 and above are automatically \\nassessed for eligibility. Those who qualify for the SSS will be notified by the CPF Board. All \\nrecipients of the enhanced SSS will receive their first payment in December 2024.   \\n \\nSilver Support payments will continue to supplement the monthly cash assistance provided by \\nthe ComCare Long-Term Assistance (“LTA”) Scheme1. All Singaporeans aged 65 and above \\nwho are ComCare LTA beneficiaries will receive a Silver Support payment of $430 per quarter. \\nAside from monthly cash assistance to cover daily living expenses, ComCare LTA \\nbeneficiaries receive assistance with their med ical bills at public healthcare institutions and \\nfree or highly subsidised social services such as home help. \\n \\n(E) Enhancements to the Matched Retirement Savings Scheme (“MRSS”) \\n \\nIn 2021, the Government introduced the MRSS as a pilot. Under the current MRSS, the \\nGovernment will match every dollar of cash top-up made to eligible CPF members aged 55 to \\n70, up to an annual cap of $600. Anyone, including their families, employers, and the \\ncommunity, can make the top-ups to these eligible members’ CPF Retirement Account (“RA”). \\nGivers may also be entitled to tax relief ( i.e., CPF Cash Top-Up Relief) for cash top -ups that \\nattract the MRSS matching grant. \\n \\n \\n1 Also known as the Public Assistance Scheme. The Scheme is targeted at those who are permanently unable to \\nwork due to old age, illness or disability, have limited or no means of income, and little or no family support.  \\n\\n \\n5 \\nMINISTRY OF FINANCE \\nThe Government will continue the MRSS beyond the current pilot, expand the age \\neligibility, and increase the matching grant cap from 1 January 2025  (details in Table 5). \\nThis is to strengthen Singapore’s social compact and enable more seniors to meet their \\nretirement needs. \\n \\nFrom 1 January 2025, we will also remove the tax relief that givers may get on cash top -\\nups that attract the MRSS matching grant (see Table 5), as the matching grant is already a \\nsignificant benefit extended by the Government. A giver may continue to enjoy tax relief of up \\nto $16,000 a year for eligible CPF cash top-ups that do not attract the MRSS matching grant2.  \\n \\nTable 5: Changes to the MRSS from 1 January 2025 \\nChanges Current From 1 January 2025 \\nIncrease in \\nmatching grant \\ncap \\n$600 per year $2,000 per year, with a $20,000 cap \\nover an eligible member’s lifetime \\nRemoval of age \\ncap \\n55 to 70 years old 55 years old and above \\nRemoval of tax \\nrelief on cash \\ntop-ups for \\ngivers \\nGivers are eligible for tax relief \\non cash top -ups they make to \\nMRSS-eligible members \\nGivers are not eligible for tax relief on \\ncash top -ups that attract the MRSS \\nmatching grant \\nNote: \\n1. There is no change to the other eligibility criteria: \\na. RA savings below prevailing Basic Retirement Sum. RA savings refer to the cash set aside in \\nthe RA (excluding amounts such as interest earned, any government grants received) plus \\namounts withdrawn such as monthly payouts and lump-sum withdrawals; \\nb. Average monthly income not more than $4,000;  \\nc. Owns not more than one property; and \\nd. Annual value of residence is not more than $21,000. \\n \\nWith the enhancements, the number of CPF members eligible for MRSS is expected to increase \\nfrom 395,000 in 2024 to approximately 800,000 in 2025.  \\n \\nMRSS eligibility is automatically assessed every year. CPF Board will notify eligible members \\nat the beginning of each year and members can also check their eligibility via the CPF website. \\nAs long as eligible members receive a cash top -up within the year,  they will receive the \\nmatching grant the following year.  \\n \\n  \\n \\n2 A member may continue to enjoy tax relief of up to $8,000 per year for cash top -ups he makes to his own SA, \\nRA or MediSave Account, and another $8,000 per year for cash top-ups to such accounts of his loved ones.  \\n\\n \\n6 \\nMINISTRY OF FINANCE \\nMore Information \\n \\nMeasure Contact Details \\nIncrease in Senior Worker CPF Contribution Rates Please contact the CPF \\nBoard at \\ncpf.gov.sg/contact-us   Increase   in Enhanced Retirement Sum \\nClosure of the CPF Special Account for Members Aged 55 \\nand Above \\nSilver Support Scheme \\nMatched Retirement Savings Scheme \\nCPF Transition Offset Please contact IRAS at \\ngo.gov.sg/askpayout1', mimetype='text/plain', start_char_idx=2, end_char_idx=12294, text_template='{metadata_str}\\n\\n{content}', metadata_template='{key}: {value}', metadata_seperator='\\n'),\n",

More than 1 million Singapore Citizens and Permanent \\nResidents are expected to benefit from higher subsidies when the revised means -test income \\ncriteria are implemented by 4Q 2024. \\n \\nMOH and MSF provide means -tested subsidies and grants to support Singapore Citizens and \\nPermanent Residents with the costs of healthcare and associated social support services, with \\nhigher subsidies extended to lower -income groups. Taking into consideration changes in \\nhousehold incomes, and costs of healthcare and associated social support services, MOH and \\nMSF will be revising the income criteria for healthcare and associated social support schemes \\nand services that are means -tested using the monthly per capita household income ( “PCHI”)1 \\ncriteria. \\n \\nThe schemes and services with revised income criteria are: \\n \\n(A) MediShield Life and CareShield Life Premium Subsidies; \\n(B) Community Health Assist Scheme (“CHAS”); \\n(C) Subsidies at Publicly-Funded Hospitals2; \\n(D) MOH and MSF Long-Term Care Residential and Non-Residential Services3,4; \\n(E) Community Haemodialysis and Peritoneal Dialysis Subsidies; \\n(F) Standard Drug List and Medication Assistance Fund Drugs; \\n(G) Seniors’ Mobility and Enabling Fund; \\n(H) Home Caregiving Grant; \\n(I) Interim Disability Assistance Scheme Programme for the Elderly; \\n(J) ElderFund; \\n(K) Enabling Transport Subsidy; \\n(L) Taxi Subsidy Scheme; and \\n(M) Assistive Technology Fund. \\n \\nThe monthly PCHI threshold for each subsidy tier will be raised, with increases ranging from \\n$100 to $800. Table 1  below provides the changes in the PCHI thresholds to qualify for \\nmaximum subsidies for a few key MOH and MSF schemes. Detailed changes to all schemes \\nand services are at the end of this Annex. \\n \\n \\n \\n1 Monthly PCHI is computed as the total gross household monthly income divided by the total number of family \\nmembers living together in the household. Gross monthly household income includes basic employment income, \\ntrade/self-employed income, overtime pay, allowances, cash awards, commissions, and bonuses.  \\n2 These are Acute Hospital, Day Surgery, Extended Diagnosis Treatment Unit, Community Hospital, and \\nSpecialist Outpatient Clinic settings/services. \\n3 MOH Long-Term Care Residential services include Nursing Home, Chronic Sick (High/Low), Inpatient Hospice \\nPalliative Care Service, Psychiatric Rehabilitation Home, and Psychiatric Sheltered Home. MOH Long -Term \\nCare Non-Residential services include home-based services (e.g., Home Palliative Care, Home Medical services, \\nHome Nursing services, Home Help services, Home Personal Care) and centre -based services (e.g., Community \\nRehabilitation, Maintenance Day Care, Dementia Day Care, Day Hospice,  Psychiatric Day Rehabilitation). \\n4 MSF’s Residential services include Adult Disability Home, Adult Disability Hostel, Children Disability Home, \\nand Sheltered Home. MSF’s Non-Residential services include Day Activity Centre and Home-Based Behavioural \\nIntervention Services. \\n\\n \\n2 \\nMINISTRY OF FINANCE \\nTable 1.

Qualifying overseas cash donations must meet the \\nfollowing two conditions to be eligible for tax deductions: \\n \\n(i) Donation must be made through a designated  charity. Designated charities should \\nhave emergency humanitarian assistance as part of their charitable objectives 1, as \\nwell as enhanced governance and controls against illicit fund flows. Charities that \\nqualify will be invited to participate in the pilot. The list of designated charities will \\nbe made available from 1 January 2025. \\n \\n(ii) Donation must be made towards a fund -raiser for emergency humanitarian \\nassistance with a valid Fund -Raising for Foreign Charitable Purposes ( “FRFCP”) \\npermit from the Commissioner of Charities ( “COC”). Designated charities are \\nrequired to apply for a FRFCP permit from the COC prior to commencement of a \\nfund-raising appeal for an emergency humanitarian assistance cause.  \\n \\nThe COC will determine upon reviewing the FRFCP permit application whether a fund-raiser \\nin question is for an emergency humanitarian assistance cause. Emergency humanitarian \\nassistance refers to emergency assistance tied to a specific incident with a clear trigger such as \\nin response to natural disasters (e.g. , earthquakes or floods) or other sudden crises (e.g. , \\npandemics). Assistance typically includes rapid delivery of essentials such as food, clean water, \\nshelter, medical care, and search, rescue, and evacuation efforts. \\n \\nTax deductions under OHAS will be capped at 40% of the donor’s statutory income. For donors \\nwho also receive tax deductions under the Philanthropy Tax Incentive Scheme for Family \\nOffices2 (“PTIS”), tax deductions under both OHAS and PTIS will be jointly capped at 40% \\nof the donor’s statutory income.  \\n \\nAny unutilised tax deductions under the OHAS cannot be carried forward to offset the donor’s \\nincome for any subsequent Year of Assessment ( “YA”) and cannot be transferred to another \\ncompany of the same group under the Group Relief System for any YA. \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n1 Notwithstanding these charities’ ability to carry out emergency humanitarian assistance overseas, these charities \\nmust still substantially benefit the community in Singapore. \\n2 The PTIS provides qualifying donors 100% tax deduction for overseas cash donations made through qualifying \\nlocal intermediaries, capped at 40% of the donor’s statutory income. To qualify, donors must have a fund under \\nSection 13O or 13U of the Income Tax Act 1947 and meet eligibility conditions, such as incremental local business \\nspending of S$200,000.
