The CIT Rebate, less any CIT Rebate Cash Grant received, \nwill be automatically incorporated in the companies\u2019 tax assessments raised after they file their \nCIT returns for YA 2024.  \n \nFor example, Company A hired two local employees in 2023.

This will help SMEs to meet their increased \nworking capital and operational cashflow needs, especially amid elevated costs. \n \nSecond, the enhanced maximum loan quantum under the EFS \u2013 Trade Loan of $10 million will \nbe extended till 31 March 2025.

Eligible employees will \nreceive up to $4,900 per year, compared to $4,200 per year today (see Table 1). \nOlder workers and all persons with disabilities will continue to receive the highest \npayments. The payments for self -employed persons are set at two -thirds of the \npayments for employees, and will be correspondingly increased. \n \nTable 1: Maximum Annual Workfare Payments for Employees \nAge Band \nBefore Enhancement  \n(For Work Done from 1 Jan \n2023 to 31 Dec 2024) \nAfter Enhancement  \n(For Work Done from 1 Jan \n2025) \n30-34   $2,100                       $2,450 \n35-44  $3,000  $3,500  \n45-59 $3,600  $4,200  \n60 & above  $4,200  $4,900  \nAll persons with \ndisabilities  \n$4,200  $4,900  \n \n \n  \n \n1 In addition, the worker must earn an average gross monthly wage of not more than $3,000 in the past 12 months. \n\n \n2 \nMINISTRY OF FINANCE \n \n(B) Raising the Local Qualifying Salary (\u201cLQS\u201d) \n \nAs part of our Progressive Wages moves, firms hiring foreign workers are required to pay all \ntheir local workers at least the LQS. The number of local workers paid the LQS is used to \ndetermine the firm\u2019s foreign worker quota entitlement. \n \nThe LQS is regularly reviewed to keep pace with wage growth, to continue to uplift lower -\nwage workers and maintain foreign workforce controls.  \n \nThe Government will raise the LQS from $1,400 to $1,600  per month. Firms hiring foreign \nworkers will have to pay all their local workers at least the LQS (or Progressive Wage Model \nwages where applicable):   \n \n(i) At least $1,600 per month for full-time local workers; or   \n(ii) At least $10.50 per hour for part-time local workers.   \n  \nForeign worker quota computation will correspondingly be adjusted with the new LQS:   \n \n(i) 1 local workforce count: Per local worker who is paid  at least $1,600 per month; \nor   \n(ii) 0.5 local workforce count: Per local worker who is paid at least $800 but less than \n$1,600 per month.  \n  \nThese changes will be implemented from 1 July 2024.  \n \n(C) Enhancements to the Progressive Wage Credit Scheme (\u201cPWCS\u201d) \n \nThe PWCS was introduced at Budget 2022 to provide transitional support from 2022 to 2026 \nto help employers adjust to the Progressive Wages moves, as well as encourage employers to \nvoluntarily raise the wages of their lower-wage employees.  \n  \nThe PWCS co-funds the wage increases that employers give to resident lower-wage employees \nwith gross monthly wages of up to $3,000. The average gross monthly wage increase must be \nat least $100 in each qualifying year. Wage increases given in each qualifying year will be co-\nfunded for two years, if the wage increase is sustained. This is to help employers manage the \ncompounding effect of wage increases year on year. \n  \nIncrease in PWCS Co-Funding Support for 2024 \n  \nTo strengthen support for employers in uplifting lower-wage employees, the PWCS co-funding \nsupport will be enhanced for wage increases given in qualifying year 2024 (see Table 2). The \nenhanced co-funding support will also apply to wage increases given in qualifying year 2023 \nthat are sustained in 2024.  \n  \nIncrease in Wage Ceiling for PWCS Co-Funding from 2025 Onwards \n  \nThe gross monthly wage ceiling for PWCS co-funding will be increased from $2,500 to $3,000 \nin qualifying years 2025 and 2026 (see Table 2).  \n \n\n \n3 \nMINISTRY OF FINANCE \n \nTable 2: PWCS Co-Funding Levels for Eligible Wage Increases from 2022 to 2026 \nQualifying \nYear  \nPayout \nPeriod  \nCurrent Enhanced \nFirst Tier:  \nGross Monthly \nWage Ceiling \n\u2264 $2,500  \nSecond Tier: \nGross Monthly \nWage Ceiling   \n> $2,500 and \u2264 \n$3,000  \nFirst Tier:  \nGross Monthly \nWage Ceiling \n\u2264 $2,500  \nSecond Tier:  \nGross Monthly \nWage Ceiling   \n> $2,500 and \u2264 \n$3,000  \n2022  Q1 2023  75%1 45%1 75% 45% \n2023  Q1 2024  75%2 45%2 75% 45% \n2024  Q1 2025  30% 15% 50% \n(+20%-pt) \n30% \n(+15%-pt) \n      \nSingle Tier:  \nGross Monthly Wage Ceiling \u2264 \n$2,500  \nSingle Tier:  \nGross Monthly Wage Ceiling \u2264 \n$3,000 \n(+$500) \n2025  Q1 2026  30%  30% \n2026  Q1 2027  15%  15%  \nNotes: \n1.

Today, the ERS is set at three times the Basic Retirement Sum (\u201cBRS\u201d).  \n \nThe Government will raise the ERS from three times the BRS, to four times, from 1 \nJanuary 2025 (see Table 3). This will allow CPF members to voluntarily top up more to their \nRA, by transferring their Ordinary Account (\u201cOA\u201d) savings or by making cash top-ups, in order \nto receive higher CPF monthly payouts in their retirement.  \n \nTable 3: Revised ERS from 2025 to 2027 \nYear BRS \nBefore Changes \n \n(ERS at three times the \nBRS) \nRevised ERS from 1 \nJanuary 2025  \n(ERS at four times the \nBRS) \nERS \nEstimated \nmonthly \npayouts \nERS \nEstimated \nmonthly \npayouts \n2025 $106,500 $319,500 $2,530 $426,000 $3,330 \n2026 $110,200 $330,600 $2,610 $440,800 $3,440 \n2027 $114,100 $342,300 $2,690 $456,400 $3,550 \nNotes: \n1. There are no changes to the previously announced BRS and Full Retirement Sum for 2025 to 2027. \n2. Estimated monthly payouts are based on the payouts of a  male member who sets aside the ERS at age \n55 and starts payouts under the CPF LIFE Standard Plan at age 65. \n \nWith the raising of the ERS, more members aged 55 and above can opt to fully commit their \naccumulated CPF savings to receive higher CPF payouts.  \n \n \n \n \n\n \n3 \nMINISTRY OF FINANCE \n(C) Closure of the CPF Special Account (\u201cSA\u201d) for Members Aged 55 and Above \n \nToday, members aged 55 and above have two CPF accounts that hold savings intended for \nretirement payouts: the CPF SA and the Retirement Account (\u201cRA\u201d). Both SA and RA savings \nearn the same long-term interest rate. However, some SA savings can be withdrawn on demand \nfrom age 55. As a principle, only savings that cannot be withdrawn on demand should earn the \nlong-term interest rate, and savings that can b e withdrawn on demand should earn the short -\nterm interest rate.  \n \nTo better align CPF interest rates to the nature of CPF savings  in each CPF account , the \nGovernment will close the SA for members aged 55 and above from early 2025. SA savings \nwill be transferred to the RA, up to the Full Retirement Sum . These savings will continue to \nearn the long-term interest rate. Any remaining SA savings will be transferred to the Ordinary \nAccount (\u201cOA\u201d), where they remain withdrawable and will earn the short-term interest rate.  \n \nMembers can choose to transfer their OA savings to their RA at any time, up to the Enhanced \nRetirement Sum. Once transferred to the RA, the monies will be committed towards higher \nretirement payouts and will earn higher interest.   \n \nWith the closure of the SA for members aged 55 and above, all members will have three CPF \naccounts at any one time: \n \n\u2022 For members below age 55, they will continue to have OA, SA, and MediSave Account \n(\u201cMA\u201d).   \n\u2022 For members aged 55 and above, they will only have OA, RA, MA.  \n \n(D) Enhancements to the Silver Support Scheme (\u201cSSS\u201d) \n \nThe SSS supports Singaporeans aged 65 and above who had low incomes during their working \nyears, and have less family support.  \n \nThe SSS will be enhanced to strengthen support for these seniors. From 1 January 2025:  \n \n(i) Quarterly payments will be raised by 20% across all payment tiers (see Table 4 \nbelow).  \n \n(ii) Criterion for monthly per capita household income  will be raised. \nSingaporeans aged 65 and above with monthly per capita household income of not \nmore than $2,300 and meet all other eligibility criteria will be eligible for the SSS, \nup from the current criterion of $1,800 (see Table 4 below).  \n \n  \n\n \n4 \nMINISTRY OF FINANCE \nTable 4: Current and Enhanced Silver Support Quarterly Payments from 1 January 2025 \nHDB Flat \nType2 \nCurrent From 1 January 2025 \nTotal CPF contributions of not more than $140,000 by age 551 \nMonthly per \ncapita \nhousehold \nincome of \n$1,300 or less \nMonthly per \ncapita \nhousehold \nincome above \n$1,300 but not \nmore than \n$1,800 \nMonthly per \ncapita \nhousehold \nincome of \n$1,500 or less \nMonthly per \ncapita \nhousehold \nincome above \n$1,500 but not \nmore than \n$2,300 \n1- and 2-\nroom $900 $450 $1,080 $540 \n3-room $720 $360 $860 $430 \n4-room $540 $270 $650 $325 \n5-room3 $360 $180 $430 $215 \nNotes: \n1. Self-employed persons should also have an average annual net trade income of not more than $27,600 \nwhen they were aged 45 to 54.  \n2. Neither s enior nor his or her spouse  should owna 5 -room or larger HDB flat or private property or \nmultiple properties. \n3. Senior may live in, but do not own, a 5-room HDB flat.  \n \nThe enhanced SSS will benefit around 290,000 Singaporeans aged 65 and above. \n \nThere is no need to apply for the SSS. All Singaporeans aged 65 and above are automatically \nassessed for eligibility. Those who qualify for the SSS will be notified by the CPF Board. All \nrecipients of the enhanced SSS will receive their first payment in December 2024.   \n \nSilver Support payments will continue to supplement the monthly cash assistance provided by \nthe ComCare Long-Term Assistance (\u201cLTA\u201d) Scheme1. All Singaporeans aged 65 and above \nwho are ComCare LTA beneficiaries will receive a Silver Support payment of $430 per quarter. \nAside from monthly cash assistance to cover daily living expenses, ComCare LTA \nbeneficiaries receive assistance with their med ical bills at public healthcare institutions and \nfree or highly subsidised social services such as home help. \n \n(E) Enhancements to the Matched Retirement Savings Scheme (\u201cMRSS\u201d) \n \nIn 2021, the Government introduced the MRSS as a pilot. Under the current MRSS, the \nGovernment will match every dollar of cash top-up made to eligible CPF members aged 55 to \n70, up to an annual cap of $600. Anyone, including their families, employers, and the \ncommunity, can make the top-ups to these eligible members\u2019 CPF Retirement Account (\u201cRA\u201d). \nGivers may also be entitled to tax relief ( i.e., CPF Cash Top-Up Relief) for cash top -ups that \nattract the MRSS matching grant. \n \n \n1 Also known as the Public Assistance Scheme. The Scheme is targeted at those who are permanently unable to \nwork due to old age, illness or disability, have limited or no means of income, and little or no family support.  \n\n \n5 \nMINISTRY OF FINANCE \nThe Government will continue the MRSS beyond the current pilot, expand the age \neligibility, and increase the matching grant cap from 1 January 2025  (details in Table 5). \nThis is to strengthen Singapore\u2019s social compact and enable more seniors to meet their \nretirement needs. \n \nFrom 1 January 2025, we will also remove the tax relief that givers may get on cash top -\nups that attract the MRSS matching grant (see Table 5), as the matching grant is already a \nsignificant benefit extended by the Government. A giver may continue to enjoy tax relief of up \nto $16,000 a year for eligible CPF cash top-ups that do not attract the MRSS matching grant2.  \n \nTable 5: Changes to the MRSS from 1 January 2025 \nChanges Current From 1 January 2025 \nIncrease in \nmatching grant \ncap \n$600 per year $2,000 per year, with a $20,000 cap \nover an eligible member\u2019s lifetime \nRemoval of age \ncap \n55 to 70 years old 55 years old and above \nRemoval of tax \nrelief on cash \ntop-ups for \ngivers \nGivers are eligible for tax relief \non cash top -ups they make to \nMRSS-eligible members \nGivers are not eligible for tax relief on \ncash top -ups that attract the MRSS \nmatching grant \nNote: \n1. There is no change to the other eligibility criteria: \na. RA savings below prevailing Basic Retirement Sum. RA savings refer to the cash set aside in \nthe RA (excluding amounts such as interest earned, any government grants received) plus \namounts withdrawn such as monthly payouts and lump-sum withdrawals; \nb.

Emergency humanitarian \nassistance refers to emergency assistance tied to a specific incident with a clear trigger such as \nin response to natural disasters (e.g. , earthquakes or floods) or other sudden crises (e.g. , \npandemics). Assistance typically includes rapid delivery of essentials such as food, clean water, \nshelter, medical care, and search, rescue, and evacuation efforts. \n \nTax deductions under OHAS will be capped at 40% of the donor\u2019s statutory income.
